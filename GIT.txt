1. By default your repository has one branch named "master" which is considered to be the definitive/conclusive/final/ultimate branch.

Practice-1.1:-
-->Checkout the code to your machine:
	1.1. Clone the branch you want.
		git clone -b <brach_name> --single-branch <git_repo> <destination>
		Ex: git clone -b Mx_Dev --single-branch https://github.com/venkatasykam/hello-world.git /d/hari/git/dummy/hello-world_mx

-->Update coded & check-in to git "local" repo:-
	1.2 Update the code on local, commit to local repo and then push to your git repo.
	1.3. Modified a file and ADD a new file and run the comamnd "git status -s"
		-->Added a new line in the file.
		-->Updated the exisitng line.
		-->Removed few number of lines.
	1.4. See the diff b/w remote repo and local repo "git diff".
	1.5. git commit -m "updated few files".-->committed to local repo.
-->Push the local repo to GIT repo.
	git push.

Switch to other branch: git checkout -b <branchName>

Practice-1.2:-
How to Clone the branch(readme-edits) other than 'master' and modify the files and then commit to the repository 'readme-edits'.

	2.1. Clone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17383217/clone-from-a-branch-other-than-master

		git clone --help

		Option-1:- Cloning "master" and then switch to other branch.
		----------
			git clone <url> <destination>

				Ex: git clone https://github.com/venkatasykam/hello-world.git Dev_Branch

			git branch -l
			git checkout <branchname>
				Ex: git checkout Dev_Branch
			git branch -l

		Option-2:- Clone the particular branch
		----------
			git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>

				Ex: git clone -b Us_Dev https://github.com/venkatasykam/hello-world.git hello_world_us

	2.2. Updated something and commit to the branch.

			git commit -am "updated AddNumbers.java file with subtraction method"

	2.3. git push

2. DIFF: (Create patch file and apply patch file):

	git log --oneline --all
	2.1. Diff b/w two revision numbers: git diff from-commit to-commit > output-file
			from-commit – the point at which we want the patch to start. 
			to-commit – the patch will span the changes up to and including this point.
			output-file – the patch will be written here

	2.2. Assume I had checkout the code and now my repo origin is 'Dev_Branch'. Then, modified few files. Checking the diff b/w local and remote repo.
			git diff>patch.diff
			
			git apply patch.diff

	git diff $(git merge-base <public branch> <experimental branch>) > <output file>

		Example: git diff $(git merge-base master Dev_Branch) > anotherPatch.diff

	git am 0001-updated-readme-file.patch --ignore-whitespace --no-scissors --ignore-space-change [not working]

3. GIT merging two branches: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging

	3 branches: 

4. Rename the existing branch:
	4.1. switch to branch which needs to be renamed: git checkout -b <old_name>
	4.2. git branch -m <new_name>
	4.3. git push origin :<old_name>
	4.4. git push origin <new_name>:refs/heads/<new_name>

	OR 
	4.1. git branch -m Dev_Branch Mx_Dev
	4.2. git push origin :Dev_Branch
	4.3. git push origin Mx_Dev

	-->git branch -a -->Display all the branches which are there under the repo.

	-->We can change the default branch from "master" to anyother. Click on the project(repo)-->settings-->branches-->here we can project the branches, and update default branch.

	-->Rename/delete/transferOwnership/chnage the mode public or prtivate
			repo: repo-->settings-->options

	-->Adding user: repo-->settings-->collaborators

	-->Check WebHooks on repo-->settings-->WebHooks in office

5. Transfer the repo to another organization or owner: https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization/

	5.1. Go to project repo "JarProjects" under the organization "MainLinee-FP9".  https://github.com/MainLine-FP9/JarProjects
	5.2. Settings-->Danzer Zone-->Click on "Transfer" button at "Transfer ownership".
	5.3. In the window-->enter the repo name "JarProjects" and target "organization" name "Maintenance-FP9".

6. Creating a new repo(in same organization or other organization) from exisitng repo at particular branch.
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9527999/how-do-i-create-a-new-github-repo-from-a-branch-in-an-existing-repo
 
	6.1. Create a new_repo. 
			Ex: https://github.com/MainLine-FP9/new_repo.git [in anotehr org]
			Ex: git push https://github.com/venkatasykam/new_repo.git +Us_Dev:master [under the same user]
	6.2. Clone the existing repo to new folder or update("git pull") the cloned existing repo.
			Ex: Existing repo https://github.com/venkatasykam/hello-world.git 
			This repo has 3 branches Us_Dev, Mx_Dev, master, Now I want a new repo with the code base "Us_Dev".
	6.3. git push https://github.com/MainLine-FP9/new_repo.git +Us_Dev:master
		 git push tps://github.com/venkatasykam/new_repo.git +Us_Dev:master

7. Merge from one organization/repo to anotherOrganization/repo.

	7.1. There should be a fork betweeen the two repos. Ex:
